# Another Meme Generator

This project is an experimental meme generator that is built using React and [ffmpeg.wasm](https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/). The app leverages ffmpeg to create a gif of a video file from the user. It also uses ffmpeg's drawtext filter to display text on the output gif. [Example on Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/ea07cdf56c574b35b776b907dab3d1d7)

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).
